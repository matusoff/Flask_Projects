# Flask Projects

This repository is a compilation of various web applications and APIs I've developed using Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. These projects range from simple web apps to more complex RESTful APIs, showcasing the versatility and power of Flask in web development.

## Overview

Each project within this repository demonstrates different aspects of web development with Flask, including but not limited to:

- Web application routing and templating
- Implementing RESTful APIs
- Integrating with databases (SQL and NoSQL)
- User authentication and authorization
- Utilizing Flask extensions like Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate, and Flask-Login
- Image Colour Palette Generator: A website that finds the most common colours in an uploaded image (app.py, index.html).
